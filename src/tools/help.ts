const TOOL_HELP: Record<string, string> = {
  "list-servers": `list-servers — Discover available SSH servers.

Parameters:
  refresh  (boolean, optional)  When true, re-collects live system status
           (hostname, CPU, memory, disk, GPUs) from all enabled servers.
           Without this, cached status from connection time is returned.

Returns: JSON array of server objects with name, host, port, username,
         connected, enabled, and optional status.

Example:
  list-servers                   → cached info
  list-servers { refresh: true } → fresh system status`,

  "execute-command": `execute-command — Run a shell command on a remote server.

Parameters:
  cmdString       (string, required)   The shell command to execute.
  connectionName  (string, see below)  Target server name from list-servers.
  stream          (boolean, optional)  Default true. Set false for short
                  commands when you only need the final output.
  reuseConnection (boolean, optional)  Default true. Set false after a timeout
                  or suspected stale cached SSH connection to force a fresh
                  TCP/SSH connection for this command.
  vvv             (boolean, optional)  Default false. Append bounded
                  SSH/channel debug output. Use with reuseConnection=false
                  when you need fresh handshake logs.
  timeout         (number, optional)   Per-attempt phase timeout in ms:
                                      SSH setup, exec-channel open, and
                                      remote command execution each use this
                                      cap.
                  Defaults: 300000 (stream) / 30000 (non-stream).

connectionName rule:
  • If only one server is enabled → optional (auto-selected).
  • If multiple servers are enabled → REQUIRED.

Examples:
  execute-command { cmdString: "pwd" }
  execute-command { cmdString: "docker ps -a", connectionName: "prod", stream: false }
  execute-command { cmdString: "tail -f /var/log/syslog", stream: true, timeout: 600000 }
  execute-command { cmdString: "hostname", connectionName: "scnet", stream: false, reuseConnection: false }
  execute-command { cmdString: "hostname", connectionName: "scnet", stream: false, reuseConnection: false, vvv: true }`,

  "show-whitelist": `show-whitelist — Show the active command policy for a server.

Parameters:
  connectionName  (string, see below)  Target server name from list-servers.

connectionName rule:
  • If only one server is enabled → optional (auto-selected).
  • If multiple servers are enabled → REQUIRED.

Returns: Command mode, built-in blacklist, configured whitelist/blacklist patterns, and example commands when whitelist mode is active.`,

  "close-connection": `close-connection — Close a cached SSH connection.

Parameters:
  connectionName  (string, see below)  Target server name from list-servers.

connectionName rule:
  • If only one server is enabled → optional (auto-selected).
  • If multiple servers are enabled → REQUIRED.

Behavior:
  • Closes the cached/reused SSH client for the target server.
  • Closing a jump host also closes cached targets whose jump chain uses it.
  • Does not affect reuseConnection=false commands, because those one-shot
    connections already close after each command.

Examples:
  close-connection { connectionName: "scnet" }
  close-connection { connectionName: "dcu" }`,

  "upload": `upload — Upload a single local file to a remote server over SFTP.

Parameters:
  localPath       (string, required)   File path on the MCP host.
                  Must be inside the MCP working directory.
  remotePath      (string, required)   Destination path on the remote server.
  connectionName  (string, see below)  Target server name from list-servers.
  skipIfIdentical (boolean, optional)  Default true. Skip when remote matches.
  reuseConnection (boolean, optional)  Default true. Set false after timeout
                  or suspected stale cached SSH connection.
  timeout         (number, optional)   SSH setup and SFTP channel-open timeout.
  vvv             (boolean, optional)  Default false. Append bounded SSH/SFTP debug.
                  Recursive success returns structured JSON; debug is surfaced
                  for single-file results, relay results, and recursive errors.
  fast            (boolean, optional)  Default false. Use ssh2 fastPut for
                  single-file upload throughput. Not multi-file concurrency.
  sftpConcurrency (number, optional)   Only with fast=true. Concurrent SFTP chunks.
  chunkSize       (number, optional)   Only with fast=true. SFTP chunk bytes.

connectionName rule:
  • If only one server is enabled → optional (auto-selected).
  • If multiple servers are enabled → REQUIRED.

Example:
  upload { localPath: "data.csv", remotePath: "/tmp/data.csv" }
  upload { localPath: "big.bin", remotePath: "/tmp/big.bin", fast: true,
           sftpConcurrency: 32, chunkSize: 131072 }`,

  vvv             (boolean, optional)  Default false. Append bounded SSH/SFTP debug.
  fast            (boolean, optional)  Default false. Use ssh2 fastGet for
                  single-file download throughput. Not multi-file concurrency.
  sftpConcurrency (number, optional)   Only with fast=true. Concurrent SFTP chunks.
  chunkSize       (number, optional)   Only with fast=true. SFTP chunk bytes.

connectionName rule:
  • If only one server is enabled → optional (auto-selected).
  • If multiple servers are enabled → REQUIRED.

  download { remotePath: "/tmp/big.bin", localPath: "big.bin", fast: true,
             sftpConcurrency: 32, chunkSize: 131072 }`,

  download  Pull remote → local (single file or recursive directory).
  relay     Stream a file from remote-A → remote-B via SFTP piping.
            No temp file on the MCP host, no SCP, no authorized-key
            exchange between the two servers. Each side uses its own
            existing SSH session.

Parameters for upload / download:
  mode            (string, required)   "upload" or "download"
  localPath       (string, required)   Path on the MCP host.
  remotePath      (string, required)   Path on the remote server.
  connectionName  (string, see below)  Target server name.
  recursive       (boolean, optional)  True to transfer a whole directory tree.
  reuseConnection (boolean, optional)  Default true. Set false after timeout.
  timeout         (number, optional)   SSH setup and SFTP channel-open timeout.
  vvv             (boolean, optional)  Default false. Append bounded SSH/SFTP debug.
  fast            (boolean, optional)  Default false. upload/download only:
                  use ssh2 fastPut/fastGet for each single file. Directory
                  recursion stays sequential; no multi-file concurrency.
  sftpConcurrency (number, optional)   Only with fast=true. Concurrent SFTP chunks.
  chunkSize       (number, optional)   Only with fast=true. SFTP chunk bytes.

Parameters for relay:
  mode              (string, required)   "relay"
  sourceServer      (string, required)   Server name to read from.
  sourceRemotePath  (string, required)   File path on source server.
  destServer        (string, required)   Server name to write to.
  destRemotePath    (string, required)   File path on dest server.
  reuseConnection   (boolean, optional)  Default true. Set false after timeout.
  timeout           (number, optional)   SSH setup and SFTP channel-open timeout.
  vvv               (boolean, optional)  Default false. Append bounded SSH/SFTP debug.
  fast              (boolean, optional)  Accepted but relay keeps the streaming
                    SFTP pipe path; fastGet/fastPut apply to host<->remote only.

connectionName rule (upload/download):
  • If only one server is enabled → optional.
  • If multiple servers are enabled → REQUIRED.

Examples:
  transfer { mode: "upload", localPath: "dist/", remotePath: "/opt/app/dist", recursive: true }

  "help": `help — Show detailed usage for one or all tools.

Parameters:
  tool  (string, optional)  Tool name to get help for.
        If omitted, shows a summary of all available tools.

Example:
  help                           → overview of all tools
  help { tool: "execute-command" } → detailed usage for execute-command`,
};

const TOOL_OVERVIEW = `Available tools (use help { tool: "<name>" } for details):

  list-servers      Discover available SSH servers and their status.
  execute-command   Run a shell command on a remote server.
  show-whitelist    Show the active command policy.
  close-connection  Close a cached SSH connection for a server.
  upload            Upload a single file to a remote server.

  help              Show this help or detailed per-tool usage.

Quick start:
  1. list-servers → discover server names
  2. show-whitelist { connectionName: "<name>" } → inspect command policy
  3. execute-command { cmdString: "pwd", connectionName: "<name>" }
  4. close-connection { connectionName: "<name>" } → drop a stale cached SSH client`;
